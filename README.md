## Motivation
Learning the JavaScript Algorithms through game projects is the best way to start(according to me) and so was planned by me but I was confused with what game to start.
Then came the word **Whack a mole** in my mind and to showcase our current scenario, I decided to make it a virus smashing game.
## Technologies
Project is created with:
* JavaScript
* CSS
## Features
* Algorithm which prevents redundancy and makes the mole(virus) appear through random holes
* Gives an level up alert on accomplishing given goal
* Difficulty increases on successive levels
## To Do
* Add a highscore leaderboard and store scores of different users
